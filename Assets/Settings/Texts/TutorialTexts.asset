    - "Let\u2019s Merge! Tap on an empty tile to place a block. You can always see
      the blocks that are up next at the bottom."
    - Nicely Done! The number goes up by absorbing adjacent blocks of the same color.
    - Older Blocks absorb newly placed ones. Blocks with the larger number will absorb
      smaller numbers.
    - For the number 3 to go up it has to absorb 3 adjacent blocks of the same color.
    - These blocks can be separate blocks that touch the number 3 from different
      sides. Place 3 blocks of the same color around the 3 Tile.
    - You could place three 1 number tiles or One 1 number 1 tile and one 2 number
      tile or just one 3 number tile.
    - Well Done! Your tile is number 4 now. For the number to go up, it has to touch
      4 blocks of the same color.
    - You will gain more points for larger numbers! Make the number go up!
