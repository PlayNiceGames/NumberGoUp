    _valueData:
    - "Let\u2019s Merge! Tap on an empty tile to place a number. Numbers in que are
      shown at the bottom"
    - Nicely Done! Number Go Up by absorbing adjacent blocks of the same color and
      value
    - Older Blocks absorb newly placed ones. Blocks with the larger number will absorb
      smaller numbers
    - For the Number 3 to Go Up it has to absorb 3 adjacent blocks of the same color
    - The blocks could be 1+1+1 or 2+1. They just need to be adjacent to 3
    - The blocks adjacent to 3 need to add up to 3
    - For the Number to Go Up, blocks need to add up to 4
    - You will gain more points for larger numbers! Make the Number Go Up
    - Done with the Basics? Start Playing or select Next for Special Merges
    - PLAY
    - NEXT
    - Largest Merge
    - If a block can merge with multiple blocks, it will choose the Largest Block
    - Center Merge
    - 3 Adjacent Blocks of the same value will merge towards the Center
    - Mixed Blocks
    - Mixed Blocks follow all the regular rules, except with two colors. Use them
      wisely!
    - NUMBER GO UP!
    - You're Done! Please Enjoy
    - Double Merge
    - When a block can merge with two blocks of the same number, it will and the
      Number Go Up in both
    - Basic Rules
    - Adjacent Blocks
    - Older Blocks
    - 1+1+1=3
    - Different Ways
    - Number Go Up
    - High Score!
    - The Eraser can remove blocks you don't like OR tap an empty tile if you don't
      feel like removing a block
    - The Eraser
    - The Mixed Block can split among existing solid blocks aready placed on the
      board
    - Mixed + Regular
    - Mixed Blocks can work as part of a merge for regular blocks as well
    - 1+1 = 2, Even if one block is part of a Mixed Block
    - Regular + Mixed
    - Regular blocks can also merge into mixed blocks that are already on the board
    - The Mixed Block formed as a result of the merge can further merge into older
      blocks on the board
    - 2+1+1, 3+1
    - 2+1 > 1+1 , When both are possible
    - '2+2 Merge could occur on either side, so all 3 merge together '
    - 2+2 .. +2?
    - 2+1 Merge could occur with both blocks so Number Go Up in both
